# dfs
DFS - Duplicate File Searcher, as the name implies, searches for duplicate files. It does so by hashing each file in a given directory tree and then producing a map of these hashes and their corresponding files.
The map is then printed out into an .odt file for further analyzation. This is accomplished using the jOpenDocument library available at http://www.jopendocument.org/
